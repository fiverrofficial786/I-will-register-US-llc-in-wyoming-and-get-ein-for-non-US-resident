An LLC, or Limited Liability Company, is a business structure that establishes a company as a separate entity, providing the business owner with liability protection. This means that the business's owner(s) cannot be held financially liable for business debts. Furthermore, LLC owners benefit from certain tax advantages over other business structures.
